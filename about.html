<h2 class="fw-bold">About Me</h2>
<hr>

<p>
I am a Python and Django developer with a strong interest in building
AI-powered applications. I enjoy working on real-world projects,
especially chatbots using local LLMs like Ollama and Mistral.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am seeking internships or entry-level roles where I can
apply my skills, learn from industry experience, and grow as a developer.
